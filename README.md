# muyi-stopwatch
An app that has all the functions of a stopwatch except the share button.
it might not be so flashy in terms of design, but its functionality is top-notch.

It is as accurate as any stopwatch on earth. It depends on setInterval function to create milliSeconds, 
and as milliSeconds clock 100, second increases by one. 
as second clocks 60, a minute is created
as minute clocks 60, hour increases by one.
